\section{Building a simple user interface}
\label{sec:building-simple-user}

Declaring your UI layout in XML rather than runtime code is useful for
several reasons, but it's especially important so you can create
different layouts for different screen sizes. For example, you can
create two versions of a layout and tell the system to use one on
``small'' screens and the other on ``large'' screens. For more
information, see the class about Supporting Different Devices.
